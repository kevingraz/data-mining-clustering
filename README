Instructions for running Assignment 3: Clustering

K-MEANS ALGORITHM

The k-means algorithm is implemented in the k_means.m function.

To test the k-means function on the given data sets (Iris and YeastGene), 
open the iris_k_means.m and yeast_gene_k_means.m files in MATLAB and run 
them seperately. Plots for both data sets will appear.


AGGLOMERATIVE ALGORITHM

The agglomerative algorithm is implemented in the agglomerative.m function.

To test the agglomerative function on the given data sets (Example and Utilities),
open the example_agglomerative.m and utilities_agglomerative.m files in MATLAB
and run them separately. Merger data is displayed in the command window.
